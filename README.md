🔭 I’m a Senior Smart Contract Engineer at [Opyn](https://www.opyn.co/) working on designing and building secure and decentralized financial systems.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about Layer 2 and scalibility solutions like optimistic rollups and zk-EVMs, digging deeper into the EVM architecture and trying to write some code in Rust 🦀.
